# drupal-imagezoom
Drupal imagezoom module updated for D9/10, using same elevatezoom-plus js library

A few minor changes are all that is needed to keep this useful little module running. Here is an uncommented but working version. Someone, possibly me, can clean things up and get imagezoom off the deprecated list.
